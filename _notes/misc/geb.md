**Notes on Godel, Escher, Bach**

# meta

- *strange loop* = paradox - self-referential
- zen enlightenment
  - goal: transcend **dualism** = division into concepts (perception, words do this)
  - words give you some truth but always fail to describe some parts of the truth

# music

- **canons** - repeat w/ subtle changes (e.g. pitch shift)
- **fugue** - repeat w/ more substantial changes

# ai

- essential abilities - **can we do these things unsupervised?**
  - to recognize the relative importance of different elements of a situation
  - to find similarities between situations despite differences which may separate them;
  - to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link them
  - to synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together in new ways
- intelligence consists of rules at different levels
  - "just plain" rules - like reflexes which respond to stereotyped situations
  - metarules - when situations are mixtures of steretoyped situations, requires rules for deciding which "just plain" rules to apply
  - rules for inventing new rules - when situations can't be classified
    - rules may have to change themselves
- messages - comparison of DNA to a jukebox
  - where is info stored? records? buttons? smashed buttons?
  - what could constitute a Rosetta stone for DNA codes?
  - 3 parts
    - frame - tells you that this is a message
    - outer - tells you how to read a message (e.g. language, style)
    - inner - actual content
  - if decoding is universal, we might call the outer message (e.g. the trigger) the message
- memory - same bits can be used for different things - part of each message specifies the instruction type

# brain

- intelligence involves a calculus of descriptions = symbols
  - symbols represent both classes + instances (maybe both depending on amount of activation / context) - def need some context
  - can have links to other symbols (+priors on these)
  - *top-down logical structure*??
  - different ways to combine symbols get blurry
    - symbols can be learned to branch, merge
  - can harness temporal firing rates to encode more
  - can grow incrementally (greedily)
- analogy of thoughts as trips on a (poorly fleshed out) map

# interpretation

- ex. top is decimal expansion of the sum of the second ($\pi/4$)
  - 7, 8, 5, 3, 9, 8, 1, 6, ...
  - 1, -1/3, +1/5, -1/7, +1/9, -1/11...

# math / logic

- **godel's thm** - limitation of any formal axiomatic system: cannot make a program to find a complete + consistent set of axioms
- **church-turing thesis** - a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine
  - no system can do computation which cannot be broken down into simple elements
- **decision procedure** - decides whether something is a theorem - must terminate
- we can think of theorems as strings in a formal system
- **interpretation** - correspondence between symbols and words
  - ideally, these are meaningful isomorphisms between codes and reality
  - not all interpretations imply meaningful (or valid) corresponding codes
  - there might be multiple, equally valid interpretations
  - consistency depends on interpretation:
  - **consistency** - when every theorem, upon interpretation, comes out true (in some imaginable world)
  - **completeness** - when all statements which are true (in some imageinable world), and which can be expressed as well-formed strings of the system, are theorems
- slightly different axioms lead to elliptical/hyperbolic geometry instead of Euclidean geometry
- godel numbering - can replace all symbols w/ numbers and all typographic rules w/ arithmetic rules
- 2 key idesas
  - strings can speak about other strings
  - self-scrutiny can be entire concentrated into a single string
- every aspect of thinking can be viewed as a high-level description of a system which, on a low level, is governed by simple, even formal rules

# causality

- what counterfactuals are the most realistic
  - different things are stable at different levels

# biology

- dna -> rna -> proteins = sequence of amino acids
  - folds w/ valrious levels of structure (like music)
- self-rep - what counts?
  - quine? instructions on jukebox? human reproduction?
