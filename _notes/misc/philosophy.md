# [scientific explanation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-explanation/) (SEP)

- distinction between scientific explanation and non-scientific explanation (although can put things on a spectrum)
- distinction between explanations and accounts which are "merely descriptive"
- these theories focus only on explanations of *why* things happen
- concepts: explanation, description, causation

## DN model = Deductive-Nomological Model

- by Popper, Hempel, Oppenheim
- explanation has 2 constituents
  - **explanandum** - sentence describing phemonenon to be explained
  - **explanans** - class of sentences used to account for the phenomenon
- deductive
  - explanans must be true
  - explanandum must be a logical consequence of the explanans
- nomological = "lawful"
  - explanans must contain a "law of nature"
  - the law of nature must be essential to deriving the explanans
- still hard to decide exactly what is a law - should be exceptionless generalizations describing regularities
  - can have probabilistic laws as well (e.g. prob of recovering after taking penicillin is high)
- why this framework
  - by framing terms of laws and cricumstances, the explanation shows that the phenomenon *was to be expected* and helps us *understand why* it occured
  - sometimes, an *explanation-sketch* uses words like cause, that can be reframed more precisely in the DN model
- counterexamples
  - assymetry (e.g. shadow length, flagpole height, sun angle) - derive shadow length seems explanatory, but not deriving flapole height
  - irrelevant details (e.g. being a man + taking birth control pills explains why you don't get pregnant)
  - feels like their is something missing about "causality", but this is difficult to pin down - suggests DN model states necessary but not sufficient conditions
  - features of an explanation must be recognized / used by users of an explanation

## statistical relevance - wesley salmon

- given some class or population *A*, an attribute *C* will be **statistically relevant** to another attribute *B* iff $P(B∣A,C) \neq P(B∣A)$
  - find a set of attributes which divide the target into a homogenous partition = even if we split the cells further, they keep the same probability
    - like in causal inference, assume no missing variables
  - then, the explanation for a new target *x* gives the cells, the prob. for each of the cells, and which cell *x* belongs to
- this method is almost information-theoretic - same explanans equally explains the same model with inverted probabilies
- ex. (Salmon, 1971) atmospheric pressure, barometer, and storm - barometer is explanatory but not causal

## causal mechanical models

## unificationist models
