# freud

- Id – set of instinctual trends
  - "contrary impulses exist side by side, without cancelling each other out. ... There is nothing in the id that could be compared with negation ... nothing in the id which corresponds to the idea of time."
- Ego – organized and realistic
- Super-ego – analyzes and moralizes – mediates between id and ego


# role of explanations

- Evaluating computational models of explanation using human judgments (pacer, et al. 2013) [[PDF](http://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/papers/FormalExplanationModelUAI2013.pdf)]
  - overton 2012 finds that explanations used something general (ex. model) to explain something specific (ex. data)
  - subsequent analysis overton 2012 finds "inference to the best explanation" - use specific instances (ex. data) to draw general inferences
  - waskan et al 2014 - must be actually intelligible
  - lombrozo 2011 - explanations are intrinsically valuable, but also play an important instrumental role in the discovery and confirmation of intuitive theories, which in turn support prediction and intervention
  - explanations should be understood in terms of their role in generating understanding (Achinstein 1983; Wilkenfeld 2014), supporting future judgments (Craik 1943; Heider 1958; Quine & Ullian 1970), or **motivating the construction of causal theories (Gopnik 2000)**
  - explanations play a role in generalizing from known to novel cases (Rehder 2006; Sloman 1994; Lombrozo & Gwynne 2014)
  - sometimes impedes learning about properties that are idiosyncratic
  - explanatory errors and “illusions” can help us identify when and why engaging in explanation is so often beneficial
  - functional approach: why do we want explanations?
    - the best explanation for persuasion or efficient storage of information, for example, may not be the one that best supports future prediction.
  - evidence (=the explanandum) provides for some hypothesis (=the explanans).
- pacer et. al 13 - given causal thing what is best explanation
  - most relevant explanation model or explnatory tree model
  - human explanatory judgments track something more like evidence, information, or relevance, and not simply the prior or posterior probability of the explanans
- desiderata
  - **simplicity**
    - if simplicity does inform explanatory preferences, it is trumped or made moot by probability
    - count simplicity vs root simplicity (root is often preferred)
  - **fruitfulness**
    - generally explanations with broader scope are better except for causal stuff
- explanations + learning
  - explanation magnifies our prior beliefs
- "negative program" - empirical results disprove philosophical intuitions
