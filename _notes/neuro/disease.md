# TIPs - using viruses for treatment

- [Leor Weinberger: Can we create vaccines that mutate and spread? | TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/leor_weinberger_can_we_create_vaccines_that_mutate_and_spread?language=en#t-798841)
  - viruses mutate, our drugs don't
  - adherence / deployment - hard to give certain the drugs
  - idea: uses viruses as treatment
    - than superspreaders will spread treatment to others
    - replaces hiv instruction set with amputated instruction set which is not harmful
    - "therapeutic interfering particles" or "TIPs" are engineered deletion mutants designed to piggyback on a virus and deprive the virus of replication material



# alzheimer's

- ![](../assets/26_1.png)
- overview
	- age-associated - tons of people get it
	- doesn't kill you, secondary complications like pneumonia will kill you
	- rate is going up
	- very expensive to treat
- *declarative* memories are affected by Alzheimer's
	- these are memories that you know
- first 2 areas to go in Alzheimer's
	1. *hippocampus*
		- patient HM had no hippocampus
			- no *anterograde* memory - learning new things
		- hippocampus stores 1 day of info
			- offloading occurs during sleep (REM sleep) to prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, V4
			- dreaming - might see images as you are offloading
	2. *basal forebrain* - spread synapses all over cortex
		- uses *Ach*
		- ignition key for entire cortex
- alzheimer's characteristics only found in autopsy
	- *amyloid plaques*
		- maybe *A-beta* causes it
		- A-beta comes from *APP*
		- *A-beta42* binds to itself 
			- prion (starts making more of itself)
			- this cycle could be exacerbated by injury
			- clumps and attracts immune system which kills local important cells
				- this could cause Alzheimer's
			- rare genetic mutations in A-beta increase probability you get Alzheimer's
			- anti-inflammation may be too late
			- can take drugs that increase Ach functions - ex. cholinergic agonists, cholinesterase inhibitors
	- *tangles*
		- tangles made of protein called *Tau*
	- most people think these are just dead cells resulting from Alzheimer's but some think they cause it

# parkinson's

- loss of substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons
	- when you get down to 20% what you were born with
	- dopaminergic neurons form *melanin* = dark color
	- hits to head can give inflammation
- know what they need to do - don't have enough dopamine to act
- treat with L Dopa -> something like dopamine -> take out globus pallidus
- *Lewy bodies* are clumps of *alpha synuclein* - appear at dopaminergic synapses
	- clumps like A-beta42
	- associated with early-onset Parkinson's (rare) associated with genetic mutations
- *bradykinesia* - slowness of movement
- age can give parksinson's
- no evidence that toxins can induce parkinsons
- *PTP/ pesticides* can induce Parkinson's in test animals
- 1/500 people
